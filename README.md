# Aker SSH Gateway
![alt text](aker_logo.png "Aker")


### What is Aker?
Aker is a security tool that helps you configure your own Linux ssh jump/bastion host. Named after an Egyptian mythology deity who guarded the borders, Aker would act as choke point through which all your sysadmins and support staff access Linux production servers. Aker SSH gateway includes a lot of security features that would help you manage and administer thousands of Linux servers at ease. For a detailed look check our [Wiki](https://github.com/aker-gateway/Aker/wiki)  


### Motivation
I couldn't find an open source tool similar to [CryptoAuditor](https://www.ssh.com/products/cryptoauditor/) and [fudo](http://www.wheelsystems.com/en/products/wheel-fudo-psm/), such tools  are beneficial if you're seeking becoming PCI-DSS or HIPAA compliant for example, regardless of security standards compliance access to the server should be controlled and organized in a way convenient to both traditional and cloud workloads.


### Roadmap
* Phase 0
  * Integration with an identity provider (FreeIPA for now)
  * Parsable audit logs (json for example to work with Elasticsearch)
  * Highly available setup

* Phase 1
  * Admin WebUI
  * Session playback
  * Live session monitoring
  * Cloud support (AWS,OpenStack etc..) or On-premises deployments
  * Command filtering (Prevent destructive commands like rm -rf)
  * Encrypt sessions logs stored on disk.
  
* Phase 2
  * Support for graphical protocols (RDP, VNC, X11) monitoring
  * User productivity dashboard
